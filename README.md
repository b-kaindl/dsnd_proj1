# Data-Driven Level Design Using SMMNet Data

## Installation

Running this notebook requires the following:
- A viewer/editor for `.ipynb` files (like Jupyter Notebook or Jupyterlab)	
- The following python packages:
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Seaborn
	- Matplotlib
	- Scikit Learn
- Leandro Mauro's [SMMNet](https://www.kaggle.com/leomauro/smmnet) data set in a folder called `/data` at the project root.

To get started you can either download the code files in this repository or clone them using `git clone`. This should be enough to set you up to play with the data.

## Motivation
This project was created for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. It is meant to provide inspiration and a potential starting point to motivate the usage of data-driven methods in game design (or level designn in particular for this example.

## Files
`dsnd_proj1.ipynb` - Jupyer notebook containing code for analysis and output.

## How to use this project
The analysis I provided here is really just the tip of the iceberg. Feel free to apply more advanced model as the dataset provides an extensive and clean starting point to begin experimentation. In addition to the inspiration provided on Kaggle, the following migh also be interesting:

- Are there better models to use than the linear model to understand what drives player popularity?
- Is there a bias among creators to prefer levels that are similar to the ones they create?

## Acknowledgements
I would really like to thank Leandro Mauro for the dataset and my Nanodegree MentorAhmed Sherif A. for providing valuable feedback to this project.
